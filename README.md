## About

Applite is a free and open-source macOS application that streamlines the installation and management of third-party apps using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). The app is built using [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/).

The main goal of the application is to bring the convenience of [Homebrew casks](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask) to the non-technical user. So the UI was designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind.
